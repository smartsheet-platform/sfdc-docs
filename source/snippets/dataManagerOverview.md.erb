Starting with version 2.2, the Smartsheet for Salesforce app also includes the [Data Manager](#data-manager---beta) feature (currently in beta). 
The Data Manager allows you to export Salesforce data to Smartsheet, import Smartsheet data into Salesforce, and save export and import configurations as reusable workflows that you can use any time.

<aside class="notice">At this time, the Data Manager provides a <b>manual-only</b> update experience (no automatic updates), but itâ€™s the first step toward delivering a fully automatic update experience (target date TBD).</aside>

Benefits of using the Data Manager include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Use Smartsheet to publish selected Salesforce data and share with internal and external stakeholders for review and feedback.
* Use Smartsheet as a light-weight data editing tool to make bulk changes to your Salesforce data. Example: export your selected Opportunities to Smartsheet, update, and import them back into Salesforce.
* Enable your project managers and other stakeholders to view and update Salesforce data using Smartsheet.
* Import your Smartsheet data into Salesforce so you can include it in your Salesforce reports.
