# Overview

When Smartsheet is integrated with Salesforce, users can link project sheets to accounts, contacts, opportunities, other CRM objects or any custom object for real-time collaboration on project tasks and related files and discussions.

<%= partial "snippets/dataManagerOverview.md.erb" %> </br>

## Versioning

There is some general confusion on the versioning for the Smartsheet for Salesforce App. Each time a new version is released the version number is incremented by one digit (i.e. 2.2, 2.3, 2.4... 2.14). So, to clarify: **v2.2 predates v2.14**.

**2.14 is the most recent version of the Smartsheet for Salesforce App.**

<aside class="notice">
<b>Note</b>: If you ever have any doubts that you are running the latest version, the <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003JSACEA4">Smartsheet for Salesforce AppExchange</a> page will always list the most recent version.
</aside>


# Requirements

To use the Smartsheet for Salesforce app, there are a few requirements:

* Smartsheet user license.
* Access to Salesforce sandbox or production instance.
* To access the [Data Manager](#data-manager---beta) feature, you will need to have [Smartsheet for Salesforce](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003JSACEA4) version 2.2 or later installed.

**Smartsheet - Plans, Pricing, and Assistance:**

After installing Smartsheet for Salesforce via the AppExchange, your users can start a <b>free 30-day trial</b> of Smartsheet by launching Smartsheet from within Salesforce and creating their first sheet. 
The user's email address (in Salesforce) serves as their email address for their Smartsheet account. 
Any users on a Trial or Basic account can be can be absorbed into a multi-user or domain license at any time, should you choose to license Smartsheet for your organization.

If a user is neither added to an existing license nor elects to upgrade their account before their trial expires, he or she will lose the ability to <b>create</b> sheets. 
They will continue to have access to sheets shared to them by other licensed users. 

<aside class="notice">For information about Smartsheet plans and pricing, see our <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/pricing">Pricing</a> page. Smartsheet can be licensed on a named user or domain-wide basis.</aside>

<aside class="notice"><b>Note</b>: Smartsheet for Salesforce features are available with a paid Smartsheet subscription. <b>Only licensed users can create new sheets in Smartsheet</b>. All other users can link to and collaborate on sheets created by licensed users.</aside>

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Configuration</span>

This section covers the process to configure Smartsheet within Salesforce. These steps are recommended in order to provide the best experience possible.

# Set Custom Field Relationships

By default, Smartsheet for Salesforce allows you to relate Smartsheets to the standard Account, Opportunity, Contact, or Case objects in Salesforce. 
If you do not need to relate Smartsheets to other types of Salesforce objects, you can skip this section.

If you want the ability to relate Smartsheets to other types of Salesforce objects, you must create a relationship between the Smartsheet object and the other object types. 
This section of the documentation describes that process. 

<br/><b><u>To create a relationship between the Smartsheet object and another object type</u>:</b><br/><br/>

<ol>
<li>
Go to <b>Setup</b> > <b>Create</b> > <b>Objects</b>.<br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
On the <b>Custom Objects</b> page, click <b>Smartsheet</b>. The <b>Smartsheet</b> object page appears:<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/1customObjects.png"><br/><br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Click <b>Custom Fields & Relationships</b>, then click <b>New</b>:<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/2smartsheet.png"><br/><br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Select the <b>Lookup Relationship</b> option, then click <b>Next</b>.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/3customField.png"><br/><br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
From the <b>Related To</b> list, choose the object to which you want to link Smartsheets, then click <b>Next</b>.<br/>
(In this example, we will use the <b>Product</b> object.)<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/4chooseRelationship.png"><br/><br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Fill in the <b>Field Label</b>, <b>Field Name</b>, and <b>Child Relationship Name</b> fields, then click <b>Next</b>.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/5newRelationship.png"><br/>
<aside class="notice"><b>Note</b>: It is recommended that you use the default values, which are the object name for the field label and field name, and "<b>Smartsheets</b>" for the child relationship name.</aside><br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Choose the appropriate field-level security for your new lookup field, then click <b>Next</b>.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/6newRelationship_2.png"><br/><br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Confirm the default settings, then click <b>Next</b>.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/7newRelationship_3.png"><br/>
<aside class="notice"><b>Note</b>: This step and screenshot will only appear for <b>Enterprise Edition</b> or higher.</aside><br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Accept or change the default related list label of <b>Smartsheets</b>, then click <b>Save</b>. You have now enabled the linking of Smartsheets to the selected object.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/customFieldRelationships/8newRelationship_4.png"><br/><br/><br/>
</li>
</ol>

<aside class="success">Repeat steps 1-9 for each additional object where you want to add a Smartsheets related list. As mentioned earlier, <b>this is not necessary for the Account, Opportunity, Contact, or Case objects</b>.</aside>

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">FAQ</span>

## Communication Error

You may encounter this error message when attempting to use the Smartsheet for Salesforce App:

<img src="images/FAQ/1errorCommunicating.png"><br/><br/>

If you see this error, it is because you are running version 1.5 or earlier of the Smartsheet for Salesforce app. In order to restore functionality, you will need to update to the latest version of the Smartsheet for Salesforce app.


# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Data Manager - Beta</span>

<%= partial "snippets/dataManagerOverview.md.erb" %>

## Private Beta

The Data Manager feature is currently available via private beta only. 
Private beta is a limited enrollment program during which we will work with a select group of Smartsheet customers to test and improve our Data Manager for Salesforce. 
Participants will not only get early access to the app, but will also help us shape its roadmap.

### How long will the private beta last?

Before we release our app to the public, we want to make sure it is stable, performs well, and is sufficiently comprehensive to address key customer scenarios. Once we feel that these criteria have been met, the beta will be phased out and we will begin a public release. Updates will be provided once we are closer to closing the beta.

### Who is eligible to participate in the private beta?

**We are looking for power users that:**

* Are current or prospective Salesforce users.
* Have access to Salesforce today, either in sandbox or production.
* Understand that this is beta software and may have issues.
* Are willing to invest the time in testing the software.
* Are willing to provide feedback on usability, defects or performance.

Current Smartsheet customers can apply to participate in the private beta (see [the next section](#private-beta-enrollment) for enrollment instructions). 

## Private Beta Enrollment

<aside class="notice">Smartsheet users who belong to either an Enterprise account or Trial account <b>do not</b> need to enroll in the private beta. Access to the Data Manager feature of the Smartsheet for Salesforce app is enabled by default for these types of accounts.</aside>

Smartsheet users who do not belong to an Enterprise account or Trial account can request access to the private beta by using the [online signup form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=cecacfac4ecf46a2a3317f8cbd9fea48). 
We will review your application and let you know whether you are a good fit for the private beta. 
If approved, this will enable access to the Data Manager feature of the Smartsheeet for Salesforce app during its beta phase. **Public release will be limited to Enterprise accounts only.**

## Requirements

* Smartsheet [user license](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/520100-user-types#licenseduser).
* Access to Salesforce sandbox or production instance.
* [Smartsheet for Salesforce](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003JSACEA4) version 2.2 or later.

## <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Installation - Beta</span>

Version 2.2 (and higher) of the Smartsheet for Salesforce app includes the [Data Manager](#data-manager---beta) feature. 
For information about installing the Smartsheet for Salesforce app, see [Installation](#installation).

<aside class="notice">Smartsheet users belonging to an account type other than Enterprise or Trial must <a href="#private-beta-enrollment">enroll</a> in the private beta in order to access the Data Manager feature.</aside>

## <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Configuration - Beta</span>

The Smartsheet for Salesforce app (version 2.2 and higher) contains two sets of features:

* The "legacy" features which allow linking sheets to standard or custom objects (via related lists). **These "legacy" features are production quality and are not the focus of the private beta program - they have not changed and continue to work as before**. If you are interested in using these features, your Salesforce administrator must follow the [Installation](#installation) and [Configuraton](#configuration) instructions as described earlier in this documentation. 

* The "Data Manager" feature is a brand new set of capabilities that enables **data export to Smartsheet**, **data import from Smartsheet**, and **two-way manual data updates**.  The Data Manager feature is available via a [private beta program](#private-beta) that is designed to provide our customers with early access to these new capabilities so that they can test-drive them and provide feedback to Smartsheet.  No additional configuration is required to enable the Data Manager.

## Accessing Data Manager

<aside class="notice">Once the Smartsheet for Salesforce app is installed in your Salesforce instance, you <b>do not</b> need to be a Salesforce administrator to use it.</aside>

Navigate to the app menu and select **Smartsheet** from the dropdown:

<img src="images/screenshots/platformSmartsheet.png" /><br/><br/>

That will immediately take you to the Smartsheet Data Manager tab:

<img src="images/screenshots/dataManager.png" /><br/><br/>

## Accepting the User Agreement

You will be asked to accept the private beta user agreement before proceeding:

<aside class="notice">Note: This will only occur the first time you access the Data Manager.</aside>

<img src="images/screenshots/userAgreement.png" /><br/><br/>

## Connecting to Smartsheet

Click **Connect to Smartsheet** after you check the **Accept License Agreement** box, then follow the steps to authorize access between the app and your Smartsheet account.

## <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Usage - Beta</span>

<aside class="notice">This section covers creating, running, and modifying workflows. </aside>

## Data Manager Dashboard

The Data Manager default view is the Dashboard that includes buttons to create new Export or Import workflows, the list of existing workflows (if any), and the History tab: 

<img src="images/screenshots/dataManagerDashboard.png" /><br/><br/> 

## Creating a New Workflow

To create an export or import workflow, click either the **New Export** or **New Import** button, then proceed through the 5 steps of the wizard to create the new workflow. 
At the end of the process, your new export or import workflow will be immediately queued up for execution.

<aside class="notice">Note: After you've created a new workflow, it is automatically saved as a reusable workflow to your Dashboard.</aside>

<img src="images/screenshots/createNewWorkflow.png" /><br/><br/>

### Insert vs Update Logic

Data manager provides the ability to create new records or update existing records in Salesforce. When creating or modifying a workflow, you must map the Salesforce object ID field to a column in Smartsheet that is designated for Salesforce record IDs ("**ID column**"). 

Workflows use the following rules to determine whether a record should be **created** or **updated** in Salesforce:

* If a row in the "ID Column" is **empty**, then a new record is created in Salesforce for that Row.
* If a row in the "ID Column" **contains data**, then Data Manager assumes a matching  record (with that record ID) already exists in Salesforce and attempts to update it.

<aside class="notice"><b>Note</b>: Each Salesforce Object has a list of required Fields when importing. Data Manager will list those required fields during the mapping step even though the "ID Column" can be blank (for inserts). 
</br></br>
In the following  example, the required fields are:
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>StageName</li>
<li>CloseDate</li>
</ul>
These fields will need data in the associated Columns in Smartsheet, otherwise the import will fail.
</aside>

Here’s the dialogue which prompts you to map your Smartsheet Columns and Salesforce Fields. You can see we’ve mapped the **ID** Column in Smartsheet to the **Opportunity ID** Field in Salesforce:

<aside class="success">Note: We chose to import an <b>Opportunity</b> from Smartsheet into Salesforce for this example.</aside>

<img src="images/screenshots/mapID.png" /> </br></br>

Based on the "ID Column" in the screenshot below, Data Manager will **update** the first 2 records, and **create** 1 new record in Salesforce (because the third row in the "ID Column" contains no data):

<img src="images/screenshots/createRecord.png" /> </br></br>

## Running an Existing Workflow

Once you create a workflow, you can run it any time from your Dashboard to update the mapped fields in the specified destination with the most current data from the specified source.

<aside class="warning"><b>IMPORTANT</b>: When you run an existing workflow, it will <b>overwrite</b> the mapped fields in the specified destination with the most current data from the specified source.</aside>

<img src="images/screenshots/runExistingWorkflow.png" /><br/><br/>

## Modifying an Existing Workflow

You can modify an existing workflow (e.g., map additional fields, add filters, etc.) without running it by clicking on the adjacent gear icon.

<img src="images/screenshots/modifyExistingWorkflow.png" /><br/><br/>

## Workflow Status and History

The History tab on the Dashboard lists every workflow that is currently queued or has previously executed. 
It will also display warnings or error messages if a workflow did not process correctly.

<aside class="notice">Use the refresh icon (located next to the History tab) to update the status of workflows that are currently processing.</aside>

<img src="images/screenshots/checkStatus.png" /><br/><br/>

## <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">FAQ - Beta</span>

### Why am I seeing the "Salesforce integration is not enabled for this Smartsheet user..." error?

After you attempt to **Connect to Smartsheet** from within the Data Manager, you may see this error message:

<img src="images/screenshots/faq1.png" /> <br/><br/>

If you see this message, it's because your Smartsheet account has not been enrolled in the [private beta program](#private-beta) for the Data Manager feature. 
Please see the [Private Beta Enrollment](#private-beta-enrollment) section for more information, or contact us at [api@smartsheet.com](mailto:api@smartsheet.com) if you believe this message is in error.
