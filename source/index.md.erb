# Overview

Smartsheet Data Manager for Salesforce allows you to export Salesforce data to Smartsheet, import Smartsheet data into Salesforce, and save export and import configurations as reusable workflows that you can use any time.  

<aside class="notice">At this time, the private beta provides a manual-only update experience (no automatic updates), but it's the first step toward delivering a fully automatic update experience (target date TBD).</aside>

Benefits of using the Data Manager include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Use Smartsheet to publish selected Salesforce data and share with internal and external stakeholders for review and feedback.
* Use Smartsheet as a light-weight data editing tool to make bulk changes to your Salesforce data. Ex.: export your selected Opportunities to Smartsheet, update, and import them back into Salesforce.
* Enable your project managers and other stakeholders to view and update Salesforce data using Smartsheet.
* Import your Smartsheet data into Salesforce so you can include it in your Salesforce reports.

# Private Beta

## What is private beta?

Private beta is a limited enrollment program during which we will work with a select group of Smartsheet customers to test and improve our Data Manager for Salesforce. Participants will not only get early access to the app, but will also help us shape its roadmap.

## How long will the private beta last?

Before we release our app to the public, we want to make sure it is stable, performs well, and is sufficiently comprehensive to address key customer scenarios. Once we feel that these criteria have been met, the beta will be phased out and we will begin a public release. Updates will be provided once we are closer to closing the beta.

## Who is eligible to participate in the private beta?

**We are looking for power users that:**

* Are current or prospective Salesforce users.
* Have access to Salesforce today, either in sandbox or production.
* Understand that this is beta software and may have issues.
* Are willing to invest the time in testing the software.
* Are willing to provide feedback on usability, defects or performance.

Current Smartsheet customers can apply to participate (see [the next section](#enrollment) for enrollment instructions).  We will review your application and let you know whether you are a good fit for the private beta.

## Enrollment

<aside class="notice">If you are on an Enterprise or Trial account you <b>do not</b> need to enroll, access to the Smartsheet Data Manager for Salesforce is enabled by default.</aside>

Members who are not using an Enterprise or Trial account can request access to the Beta by using the [online signup form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=cecacfac4ecf46a2a3317f8cbd9fea48). If approved, this will enable access to Smartsheet Data Manager for Salesforce during its beta phase. **Public release will be limited to Enterprise plans only**.

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Installation</span>

<aside class="notice">You will need the help of your Salesforce administrator to install the Smartsheet for Salesforce package.</aside>

# Existing Smartsheet for Salesforce customers

If you already have the [Smartsheet Project Management for Salesforce](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003JSACEA4) managed package installed in your Salesforce instance, your Salesforce administrator will need to make sure you have the most recent version of the managed package that includes Data Manager. If you do not have the most recent version installed, your administrator will need to upgrade your package to the most recent version.

<aside class="notice">Your administrator can check the version of the managed package by going to Setup > Installed Packages and looking at the version for the installed package “Smartsheet Project Management”.</aside>

# New Smartsheet for Salesforce customers

Your Salesforce administrator needs to navigate to AppExchange to install the [Smartsheet Project Management for Salesforce](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003JSACEA4) managed package into your Salesforce instance.

# Configuration

The Smartsheet Project Management for Salesforce package contains two sets of features:

1. The "legacy" features which allow linking sheets to standard or custom objects (via related lists). **These "legacy" features are production quality and are not the focus of this private beta program - they have not changed and continue to work as before**. If you are interested in using these features, your Salesforce administrator must follow the **Smartsheet Installation Guide for Salesforce** (found in our [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003JSACEA4) listing under DETAILS tab > CUSTOMIZATION GUIDES section) to configure them. 

2. Smartsheet Data Manager for Salesforce is a brand new set of capabilities that enables **data export to Smartsheet**, **import from Smartsheet**, and **two-way manual data updates**.  The private beta program is designed to provide our customers with early access to these new capabilities so that they can test-drive them and provide feedback to Smartsheet.  No additional configuration is required to enable the Data Manager.

# Accessing Data Manager

<aside class="notice">Once Smartsheet for Salesforce is installed in your Salesforce instance, you don't need to be a Salesforce administrator to use it.</aside>

Navigate to the app menu and select "Smartsheet" from the dropdown:

That will immediately take you to the Smartsheet Data Manager tab:

<img src="images/screenshots/dataManager.png" /></br></br>

# Accepting the User Agreement

You will be asked to accept the private beta user agreement before proceeding:

<aside class="notice">Note: This will only occur the first time you access the Data Manager.</aside>

<img src="images/screenshots/userAgreement.png" /></br></br>

# Connecting to Smartsheet

Click on "Connect to Smartsheet" after you check the "Accept License Agreement" option, then follow the steps to authorize access between the app and your Smartsheet account.

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Usage</span>

<aside class="notice">This section covers creating, running, and modifying workflows. </aside>

# Data Manager Dashboard

The Data Manager default view is the Dashboard that includes buttons to create new Export or Import workflows, the list of existing workflows (if any), and the History tab: 

<img src="images/screenshots/dataManagerDashboard.png" /></br></br> 

# Creating a New Workflow

To create an export or import workflow, click on either the "New Export" or “New Import” button. A workflow wizard will pop-up and list 5 steps to create the new workflow.  Proceed through the 5 steps in the wizard. At the end of the process, your new export or import will be immediately queued up for execution.

<aside class="notice">Note: After you've created a new workflow, it is automatically saved as a reusable workflow to your Dashboard</aside>

<img src="images/screenshots/createNewWorkflow.png" /></br></br>

# Workflow Status and History

<aside class="notice">The history tab on the Dashboard will list every workflow that is currently queued or has previously processed. It will also display warnings or error messages if the workflow did not process correctly.</aside>

When checking the status of a job that is currently processing use the refresh icon, next to the History tab, to update the listings:

<img src="images/screenshots/checkStatus.png" /></br></br>

# Running an Existing Workflow

Once you create a workflow, you can run it any time from your Dashboard to update the mapped fields in your destination with the most current data from your source:

<aside class="warning"><b>IMPORTANT</b>: When you run an existing workflow, it <b>will overwrite</b> the mapped fields in your destination with the most current data from your source.</aside>


<img src="images/screenshots/runExistingWorkflow.png" /></br></br>


# Modifying an Existing Workflow

You can modify an existing workflow (e.g., map additional fields, add filters, etc.) without running it by clicking on the adjacent gear icon:

<img src="images/screenshots/modifyExistingWorkflow.png" /></br></br>

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">FAQ</span>

## Why am I seeing the "Salesforce integration is not enabled for this Smartsheet user..." error?

After you attempt to "Connect to Smartsheet" from within the Data Manager, you may see this error message:

<img src="images/screenshots/faq1.png" /> </br></br>

If you see this message, it's because your Smartsheet account has not been [enrolled](#enrollment) in Salesforce integration access.  Please remember that your Smartsheet account must be enrolled to participate in the private beta.  Furthermore, you must be a licensed Smartsheet user to use the integration.  Please see the [Requirements](#requirements) section in this document for more information, or contact us at [api@smartsheet.com](mailto:api@smartsheet.com) for help with [private beta enrollment](#enrollment), or if you believe this is in error.
